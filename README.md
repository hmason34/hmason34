My name is Hunter Mason - I am currently working as a consultant that performs Application & Product Security assessments. Most of my projects include Web Application and API assessments, but I have been starting to dig deeper into source code, performing SAST scans and code reviews.
Within this blog, you will find various articles about things I've learned on my journey in Application & Product Security. Thanks for checking it out!
