<h1>Welcome to Hunter's Security Blog</h1>
<p>
    I am currently working as a consultant that performs Application & Product Security assessments. Most of my projects include Web Application and API assessments, but I have been starting to dig deeper into source code, performing SAST scans and code reviews.<br>
    Within this site, you will find various blogs about my journey in learning Application & Product Security. Thanks for checking it out!
